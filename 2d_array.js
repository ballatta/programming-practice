/**
 * You will need to use a data structure called a 2 Dimensional (2D) Array
 * to represent the data structure for the 12-tone row project. In fact, your
 * friend already has structured the data in a 2D array! To learn more about
 * 2D arrays, first watch this YouTube video on the data structure in general:

 * Note that the code examples in the tutorial above are in a programming
 * language called C. However, javascript is quite smiliar to C in terms of
 * syntax. The biggest difference you will notice is that they talk a lot about
 * "allocating," or "declaring," an array; because in C, you need to
 * specifically tell the computer to create space in RAM to hold your data.
 * Pretty wild! We don't need to worry about coding this in javascript, it
 * happens automagically. So, if you see "int arr[4][3]," and are wondering
 * what they are talking about, don't worry; just keep watching.
 *
 * Then, follow along with this tutorial which is specifically oriented towards
 * javascript, and put your code and notes below.
